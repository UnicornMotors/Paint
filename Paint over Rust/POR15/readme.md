>If you can afford it POR-15 will bond to AND neutralize rust and you can then paint over it with something shiny. Moisture-cured urethanes like POR-15 will turn flat within about three months once they have been exposed to UV rays. They do make a great basecoat with their rust encapsulating and converting properties, but if you'd like the coating to last, plan on topcoating it with something else shiny and UV resistant.
