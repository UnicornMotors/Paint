>For paint, it's all about the prep & Self Etch primer!
>1 Mechanically remove dirt and oxidation (Use a power device with a "Surface Conditioning" pad and then for hard to reach spots a 3M Maroon Scotchbrite pad or steel wool.)
>2 Fresh Water Rinse (Hot Water if available)
>3 Alkaline degrease and/or metal wash. (Dawn brand dishwashing detergent is the minimum, I like to use a Scotchbrite pad for applying the soap. For a better solution look for a mild etch and follow All safety instructions!)
>4 Rinse thoroughly. (Hot Water if available)
>5 Self-Etch primer applied to totally dry surface as soon as possible after the rinse. (Looking for a self-etching single part non-chromate primers, NAPA carries Martin Senour 7220 or Dupli-Color Self-Etching Primer $8)
>6 Top Coat with your paint.
