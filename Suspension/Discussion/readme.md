>Ive heard nothing but good things on POR. Just need to do good prep work on it. That plus getting an undercoat or using something like fluid film seems to work great for a lot of people.

>I dont live the rust belt or a place where we salt the roads so i have been happy with Rustoleum Rust Reformer spray paint. Its durable and works well. If i was where they salt the roads though i would do a good coat of POR (or similar) plus an undercoating and then touch up with the rustoleum when needed

>I go cheap and use tractor / implement gloss black from Tractor Supply. Reduce it and spray it, or brush or roll it on.
