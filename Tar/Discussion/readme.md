>If you want something good then use the black tar looking stuff they use for roofs on house before the shingles go on. It goes over oil and everything. I think it petromluem based, but its a bitch to get off and you can only buy it in 2.5 and 5 gallon buckets. When i got some to paint my dads axles it was like $3 for 2.5 and then you just brush it on.
